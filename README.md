# Problem
-   Lack of access to quality education
-	Need for personalized learning
-	High cost of data to facilitate online-personalized learning.
-	Difficulty in administering theoretical maths tests for students evaluation.
-	Fear of maths and other computational disciplines.


# Proposed Solution
JuggernautBot: An AI-powered bots which leverages on machine learning to engage students via trivia whilst giving users a stepwise breakdown of how the solution was arrived at, also serves as a goto thesaurus for solutions to seemingly difficult math problems.



# Proposed Stack

AI, ML, Flask, ChatBot, Chatterbot, Python, SQLAlchemy(Data Base), SQLite3

# Benefit
-   This will improve the level of student's affinity to maths and other computational subjects which will, in turn, increase the productivity of learners as they will become better at logical and critical thinking.
-   This solution which is also free will be made available offline with timely updates as the data-set grows.
-   Teachers and learning management systems can now effectively monitor and measure learners progress using CBT technique and not restricted to multiple-choice questions.


# Top-level directory layout

    └── README.md   

## Local Setup:
 1. Ensure that Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and ChatterBot are installed (either manually, or run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
 2. Run *app.py* with `python app.py`.
 3. The demo will be live at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

This source is free to use, but ChatterBot does have a license which still applies and can be found on the [LICENSE](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/blob/master/LICENSE) page.
